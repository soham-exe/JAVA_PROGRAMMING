# Java Programming

This repository contains my collection of Java programs created while learning and practicing the fundamentals of Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
It serves as a personal record of progress, from basic syntax to more advanced logic-building exercises.

---

## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Strengthen my understanding of core Java and OOP concepts.
- Develop problem-solving and logical thinking skills.
- Maintain a structured archive of practice programs.

Each program is written, compiled, and tested individually, focusing on clarity, correctness, and adherence to standard Java practices.

---

## Topics Covered
- Basic Syntax and I/O (`System.out`, `Scanner`)
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Methods and Recursion
- Classes and Objects
- Core OOP Concepts (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation)
- Exception Handling
- Collections Framework *(upcoming)*

## How to Compile and Run
To compile and run a Java program, you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

1.  **Compile the `.java` file into `.class` bytecode:**
    ```bash
    javac ProgramName.java
    ```
2.  **Run the compiled program using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM):**
    ```bash
    java ProgramName
    ```
    **Note:** Do not add the `.class` extension when running the program. The `ProgramName` must match the public class name inside the file.
